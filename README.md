# NICE-SLAM-with-Adaptive-Feature-Grids-
## Milestones

- [ ] Correctly allocate sparse feature voxels based on ground truth camera pose and depth image. Avoid using any dense arrays for storage (No need to use NICE-SLAM) => donâ€™t need the source code

- [ ] integrate into NICE-SLAM, features can be updated correctly, able to work on e.g. Replica dataset

- [ ] Test on kitti dataset, with whole pipeline (tracking & mapping) working correctly
